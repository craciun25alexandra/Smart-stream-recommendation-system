# The purpose of this project
To develop a recommendation algorithm for streams (music, podcasts, or audiobooks) based on existing data about the application's users (listeners) and stream creators (musicians, podcast moderators, etc.), or the data accumulated during the application's runtime.
Implemented in Java, there are used OOP principles and 4 design patterns: Command, Singleton, Factory and Iterator.
# Commands
The commands that streamers will be able to execute are:

```
Add Stream
List streams of a streamer
Delete Stream
```

The commands that users will be able to execute are:

```
List user's listening history
Listen to a stream
Recommend 5 streams based on preferences
Recommend 3 surprise streams
```
